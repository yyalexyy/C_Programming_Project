### - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - A program that implemented a binary search tree of strings.
### - Hunt the Wumpus Game (Graph)
  - A program that implements a simple version of an early computer game (Hunt the Wumpus).
  - Created a Graph class to store the graph by using adjacency list.
  - The program takes in three sets of input: a map specification, a starting location for the player and the Wumpus, and then the player’s sequence of moves.
  - During the game, the program give the player feedback about whether he is getting closer to the Wumpus (warmer) or further from it (colder).
  - It also provide varying levels of descriptive detail regarding the adjoining rooms.
  - If at any time the player is strictly less than two rooms away from the Wumpus, it will devour the player, the player will lose the game. If, during the course of play the user should find himself exactly 2 rooms from the Wumpus, he may use his single arrow to attempt to kill the Wumpus. If the Wumpus is exactly 2 rooms away in any direction, the player will win the game. Otherwise using a single arrow, yet failing to kill the Wumpus, should end the player’s game with a loss.
### - Infix to Postfix (Stacks & Queues)
  - A program to convert infix notation to postfix notation that will let the user input a string, and evaluate the postfix expression that will take in a string and print an ineger.
  - Implemented a stack and a queue.
### - Circle (Understanding C & Linux)
  - Computing Circumference and Area of a circle.
### - Floyd Triangle (Lab)
  - Program displays both floyd's triangle and inverted floyd's triangle.
